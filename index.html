      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey y'all I'm Lehi! I'm learing to be a web developer!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Snowflake, Arizona</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love spending time at the beach and being around friends and family!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm hoping to land a job in web developing. I don't really have a particular company I'd work for. I'm just hoping I can land a job anywhere.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Relands, Califonia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've actually been helping my wife with her blog. She didn't want to pay anyone to help her so she decided to asked me if I'd be willing to help her. So I agreed and come to find out I actually really enjoy working on computers and learing different things about them. So far I've been learning things on my own and I'm in school now because I just want to grow my knowledge in this field and hopefully make it a career.</p>
